    <p>
      I find giving my colors names much more helpful than based on their
      function, and found this awesome project created by Chirag Mehta called
      <a
        href="http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >Name That Color</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was creating huge palettes of colors for my work, and copying and
      pasting each of them into the original NTC project was rather time
      consuming.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I came up with this, an app that I can paste all my colors into and
      export them as variables with each color named by NTC.
