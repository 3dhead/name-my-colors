# Name My Colors
I find giving my colors names much more helpful than based on their function, and found this awesome project created by Chirag Mehta called Name That Color, which can be found at [http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/].

I was creating huge palettes of colors for my work, and copying and pasting each of them into the original NTC project was rather time consuming.

So I came up with this, an app that I can paste all my colors into and export them as variables with each color named by NTC.
